# Product Context: Idle Bricks

## Why This Project Exists

Idle Bricks combines the classic arcade feel of breakout with the addictive progression of idle/incremental games. The goal is to create a satisfying gameplay loop where players can watch balls smash through increasingly powerful bricks while making strategic upgrade decisions.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Passive Entertainment**: Provides engaging gameplay that doesn't require constant attention
2. **Progression Satisfaction**: Delivers the dopamine hit of numbers going up and unlocking new content
3. **Strategic Depth**: Offers meaningful choices in ball type selection and upgrade paths
4. **Mobile-Friendly Idle**: Works in browser without installation

## How It Works

### Core Loop

1. **Balls Bounce**: Autonomous balls move around the canvas, colliding with walls and bricks
2. **Bricks Break**: When hit, bricks take damage based on ball type and upgrades
3. **Coins Earned**: Destroyed bricks award coins based on tier and multipliers
4. **Upgrade/Buy**: Players spend coins on new balls or permanent upgrades
5. **Tier Up**: Breaking 100 bricks increases brick tier (harder but more valuable)
6. **Prestige**: After 10,000 bricks, players can reset for permanent +25% coin bonus

### Ball Types & Strategy

| Ball | Cost | Special |
|------|------|---------|
| Basic | 10 | Standard starter ball |
| Fast | 50 | 2x speed for more hits |
| Heavy | 100 | 3x damage, slower |
| Plasma | 500 | Pierces through bricks |
| Explosive | 1000 | AOE damage radius |
| Sniper | 2500 | Targets weakest bricks |

## User Experience Goals

- **Immediate Engagement**: Start playing within seconds of page load
- **Visual Clarity**: Easy to distinguish ball types and brick health at a glance
- **Satisfying Feedback**: Explosions, glow effects, and damage overlays
- **Simple UI**: All shop and stats visible without navigation
- **Progress Persistence**: Never lose progress due to browser refresh or closing
